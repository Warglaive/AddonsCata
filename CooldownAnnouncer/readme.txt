CooldownAnnouncer 
is an addon which announces per Whisper or in Raid, Party or Custom Channels if you use a spell successfully. 

It announces in the raid or party chat when you successfully cast cooldowns / spells. For example: 
If you start to cast Rebirth there will be an announce in your party or Raid Chat : "Combat-Rezz: PlayerName". 
If you use Power Infusion or Innervate for example, you will whisper your target with "Innervated." or "Power Infusion on you!" 
The announces will only come if you're really casting spells. If your target is out of range or out of sight, there won't be an announce. 
This addon will also check for cooldowns. So you won't get any announces if you're trying to spam a spell which is on cooldown. 

This is way better than simple macros which also announce if the cast wasn't successful, because the target is out of range, out of sight or if the spell was on cooldown. 


There are a lot of cooldowns / spells already implemented for example: 

Druid: Tranquility, Rebirth, Innervate,... 
Priest: Power Infusion, Power Word: Barrier, Pain Suppression,... 
Warlock: Soulstone Resurrection,... 
Death Knight: Raise Ally, Anti Magic Zone, Unholy Frenzy,... 
Shaman: Heroism/Bloodlust,... 

And a lot more :) 

It's possible to modify the addon easily. You can do any kind of whisper and announces on any spell. 
If you want, you can also remove an announce for any spell. 
You can also change the default announces to anything you like to. 

Just check the "How to" - instructions in setup.lua and localization.lua!
